## 🌏 Overview

**Aathi** (meaning "Origin" or "Beginning" in Tamil) is a Digital Product Passport (DPP) platform designed to turn supply chain transparency into a marketing asset. It enables producers—from the lemon farmers of Puliyankudi to the silk weavers of Sankarankovil—to create verifiable, beautiful digital twins for their products.

Scanning an **Aathi QR Label** reveals the full story of a product: its ingredients, its physical journey across the Western Ghats, and the hands that made it.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🛡️ Immutable Lineage:** Track every component with a verifiable chain of custody. Link internal passports (e.g., linking a Glass Jar passport to a Honey passport) to build a navigable supply web.
- **🚚 Logistics Journey:** A visual, chronological timeline of every batch's physical movement, from the forest floor to the shop shelf.
- **🎨 Premium UI/UX:**
  - **Glassmorphism Design:** Modern, frosted-glass aesthetics with a professional finish.
  - **Mobile-First Experience:** Optimized for both field workers (adding events) and shoppers (viewing passports).
  - **Animated Micro-Interactions:** Smooth transitions and hover effects using Tailwind CSS v4.
- **📍 Localized Branding:** Full support for Tamil script (ஆதி) and localized product data focused on the specific market context of Southern Tamil Nadu.
- **🖨️ QR & NFC Labels:** Instant generation of scan-ready labels with high-resolution QR codes and product IDs.
- **📊 Admin Console:** A powerful, full-page management dashboard providing global visibility into the verifiable supply chain.
